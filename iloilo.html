    The next three decades saw the moderate growth of Iloilo City with the establishment of fish ports, an international seaport, and other commercial firms. 
    Iloilo City also became the Regional Center of Western Visayas.

<h3 style="font-size: 17px;"> 
    In 1977, a Comprehensive Urban Development Plan for Iloilo City was approved and was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod.
    The Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance was the implementing tool. However, the 1977 Plan was unable to cope with the demands of rapid urbanization.
</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 17px;">  
    By the end of 1993, a multi-sectoral group prepared the 1994-2010 Comprehensive Development Plan of Iloilo City to amend the old plan and address the present and future challenges of urban development. 
    The plan, however, was not carried pending the approval of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB).
